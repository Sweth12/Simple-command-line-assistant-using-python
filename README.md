# Simple-command-line-assistant-using-python

My project, Personal Command line assistant is a simple version of a personal assistant which does certain trivial tasks by just typing in what we need in the command prompt (python console) and it gives us the output. Here in this code it does tasks like opening applications, opening google maps, sending emails, opening URL, does Wikipedia search, gives weather information, maintains personal diary, performs mood check and tells jokes. 

I got inspiration from personal assistants like Siri, Cortana, Jarvis etc., So I made my version of a simple personal command line assistant with certain functions that could be performed from the prompt itself.
